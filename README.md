# Create new firefox profile

In URL bar type "about:config" and click "Create a New Profile". Name it "selenium".
After, click "Launch profile in new browser" and navigate to Youtube and login with your
credentials. You can now open some other tabs too, for example with a playlist but you need
to pin them if you want them to be available in the controlled browser.
